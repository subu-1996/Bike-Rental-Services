3. Goal: Object Oriented Programming + Modules (creating a .whl file)
Description:

To create a self usable module (library) and should be installable.
Not a script library.

Create a project for :
:: (No Gear + left + right gear) bike and (No Gear + Gear) cycle rental system.
- You should able to rent the vehicle
- Cost will paid per day
- Each category will have different different costs
- Two groups Bike, Cycle
- Should not be a script
- File should be stored in the location/folder of main.py
- If file not present then create the file and make entry
- You will use
    - Classes, Functions,
    - globals (if needed, try to avoid),
    - Group, Type of vehicle (Tuples)
    - File io
    - modules (with __init__)
    - create a .whl file
- In your imported lib.whl code:
- You should be able to used following functions:
    - Selecting a vehicle
    - Selecting a date range of rental
    - Confirm Renting
    - Confirm Return
- No other functions should be allowed to be accessed normally
    - (following the rules of privacy)
- The implementation of usage of above .whl file needs to be there
- main.py < (install and )import lib.whl
- main.py file will take input from customer/user:
    - What you want to do:
        - Rent
            - type of vehicle
            - date range (start and end)
            - Confirm with Y/N (Store with file in each line)
        - Return
            - Confirm with Y/N (Remove first found entry from the file)
